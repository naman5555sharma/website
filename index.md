Namo-namah, I'm currently a first year MS(By Research) student in IIT Bombay's [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). I am working with [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) exploring microarchitecture for performance. Our [research group](https://casper-iitb.github.io/).

I graduated with Btech in Information Technology from Engineering college, Ajmer in June 2022.

If I am not working on my computer, you can find me playing cricket. Reach out to me!
